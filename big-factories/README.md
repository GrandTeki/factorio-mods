# Big factories

Spawns massive furnaces and assembly machines around the map to make the game all about building trains to connect them.
Supports buildings from Bob's and Angel's, including labs.
Options are available to make the big factories movable and/or craftable.

## FAQ
#### Why are the centrifuge recipes added to the big assembling machine, instead of being in their own big factory?
Because the image scaling doesn't work for centrifuges, and I'm not sure why. 
If you do know, let me know how to fix it and I'll update.

There's a setting to add the centrifuge recipes to the big assembling machine.
