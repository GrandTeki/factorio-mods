Factorio mod to create raw wood
-----------------------------------------------

This mod adds a technology, which allows you to research a recipe to create raw wood
from coal and water. The only requirement is automation 1.

I'm open to suggestions for better source materials.

[Download](jornwoodrecipe_0.0.1.zip)

To build from source, run `package.bat`.
Script tested on Windows only and expects a 7zip installation in `C:\Program Files\7-Zip`
