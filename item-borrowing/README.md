Item borrowing
--------------
This mod allows you to 'borrow' items. The mod will keep track of what you borrowed, and allows you to repay loans.
 Repaying is completely optional, and you can borrow as much as you want without repercussions.

To borrow items, use the console command `/borrow` and either link (shift-click) an item from your inventory, 
 a recipe from your crafting window, or simply type the internal name of the item. You will get a single stack by default,
 or you can type a number to specify a more specific number of items, e.g. `/borrow 24 iron-plate` or `/borrow 24 <item link>`.
 
You can see your current loans (up to 20 different items) by using `/debt`, and you can pay them off by using `/pay`.
