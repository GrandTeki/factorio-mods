[mod-setting-description]
quickstart-clear=Clears the entire inventory before starting to insert items. This will remove all vanilla starting equipment, and may or may not remove things inserted by other mods, depending on loading order.
quickstart-respawn=You will always get the items when the game starts. Enabling this setting will also give you items if you die and respawn. You will have duplicates if you loot your corpse.
